It is samed as 1, because we're not sure if we're gonna keep it this was for now
And maybe for example right now, the cameras are distributed in a random way, and when one pressed to not overflow the FOV, it just shows 4 under the main one when chosen
For this maybe we should do that it shows the cameras with recent activity, meaning if it catches movement


Lets note this could be done in another way, but for a demonstrator I dont see an issue
Simple asthetics also, when youre viewing cameras, it isnt recommended to have dsitractions, and black background better for eyes

Problem with caroussel
Problem with selection
Dont put too many cameras XD
